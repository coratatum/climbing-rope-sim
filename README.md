# climbing-rope-sim
This is a project for Georgia Tech's CX 4230 Modeling and Simulation class.
It is a project meant to simulate the damamge that a climbing rope sustains after a climber falls on it.
The project is a replication and slight extension of a theoretical simulation originally created by Martyn Pavier from the University of Bristol.
